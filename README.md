# Localizing Amphetamine
This is the repository for the resources needed to localize (translate) [Amphetamine](https://apps.apple.com/app/amphetamine/id937984704?mt=12). Amphetamine is a popular and powerful macOS app for keeping your Mac awake. Unlike other keep-awake utilities, Amphetamine supports advanced workflows and extensive levels of customization. Also unlike other keep-awake utilities, Amphetamine is 100% free, with no in-app purchases, ads, or data-harvesting.

Being a free app, there are no financial resources available to hire a professional company to perform the translation. If you are considering helping to translate Amphetamine to another language, first let me say <b>thank you</b>. Second, to get started, please follow these steps:
